### **Concept:**
Before/after comparison showing Duat's early warning advantage

### **AI Generation Prompt:**
```
Infographic timeline comparison, split screen showing two scenarios:
TOP: "Traditional Methods" - timeline with warning symbol appearing late, 
minimal time to react, ending in red disruption burst
BOTTOM: "DUAT Platform" - timeline with early detection symbol appearing 
much earlier, longer preparation time, ending in green checkmark,
clean modern infographic style, teal and navy blue color scheme,
professional business illustration, clear visual hierarchy --ar 16:9 --no photo
```

### **Visual Structure:**
```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
TRADITIONAL METHODS
Timeline: ━━━━━━━━━━━━⚠️━━━[React]━━💥 Disruption
             3-6 weeks notice only

DUAT PLATFORM  
Timeline: ━━━⚠️━━━━━━━━━━━━[Mitigate]━━✅ Disruption Avoided
             3-6+ months early warning
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### **Color Coding:**
- Traditional: Gray/muted colors → Red (bad outcome)
