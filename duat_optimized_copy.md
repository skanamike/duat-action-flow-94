### **THE PROBLEM SECTION**

## Why This Matters Now

> **"Supply chain opacity is among the greatest unpriced risks in enterprise operations."**

Most companies operate blind to threats lurking in their upstream supply chains. By the time traditional monitoring systems flag a problem, it's too late to avoid impact.

**The hidden costs of reactive supply chain management:**

- **Margin erosion** from unexpected material price spikes
- **Production delays** cascading through multi-tier suppliers
- **Working capital** trapped in excessive safety stock
- **Revenue loss** from fulfillment failures and stockouts
- **Competitive disadvantage** from slower response than rivals

**Duat changes the equation.** Instead of reacting to disruptions, you anticipate and mitigate them - turning supply chain intelligence from cost center to competitive weapon.

---

### **THE DUAT ADVANTAGE SECTION**

## What Makes Duat Different

### **1. Full Upstream Visibility**
Most platforms track only your direct (Tier 1) suppliers. **Duat maps your entire upstream ecosystem** - from raw material extraction through every processing and assembly tier to your finished goods.

**Why this matters:** A disruption at a lithium mine in Chile affects your electric vehicle production 6 months later. We show you this connection before your competitors know there's a problem.

---

### **2. Months-Ahead Detection**
Traditional supply chain monitoring relies on reported data - supplier surveys, shipping manifests, news reports. **Duat uses advanced satellite data and proprietary AI** to detect disruptions forming in real-time.

**The advantage:** 3-6 months early warning vs. 3-6 weeks with conventional methods. That's the difference between proactive mitigation and crisis management.

---

### **3. Predictive, Actionable Intelligence**
Alerts without guidance create noise, not value. **Duat's AI doesn't just warn you - it models the cascade impact** across your supply chain and recommends mitigation strategies.

**The result:** Clear, prioritized actions that protect margins, maintain production, and preserve competitive position.

---

### **TECHNOLOGY CREDIBILITY SECTION**

## Powered by Patented Subsurface SAR Intelligence

Duat leverages **Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite technology** to monitor global production infrastructure in real-time - regardless of cloud cover, darkness, or attempts to hide activity.

Our proprietary AI analyzes this data to:
✓ Track material flow through processing facilities  
✓ Detect production slowdowns before official reports  
✓ Identify bottlenecks forming across multi-tier networks  
✓ Model **CASCADE risk** - how disruptions propagate through your supply chain  

**This isn't guesswork. This is physics-based intelligence applied to your specific supply chain architecture.**

# Why Duat Matters

## Turning Supply Chain's Greatest Weakness into Competitive Advantage

---

### **The Problem: Unpriced Risk**

Supply chain opacity represents one of the largest unpriced risks in modern enterprise operations.

**Consider:**
- A single disruption at a lithium processing facility in Australia can halt EV production in three continents
- The 2021 Suez Canal blockage cost global trade **$9-10 billion per week**
- 75% of companies experienced supply chain disruptions in 2023, but only 15% had advance warning
- Average cost of supply chain disruption: **$184 million per event** (Gartner)

**The core issue:** Most companies only monitor their Tier 1 (direct) suppliers. But **80% of disruptions originate in Tier 2-4 suppliers** - hidden from view until it's too late to respond effectively.

---

### **The Market Opportunity**

**Total Addressable Market (TAM):**
- Global supply chain management software market: **$22.5 billion** (2024)
- Risk management and compliance software: **$12.8 billion** (2024)
- Predictive analytics for supply chain: **$8.3 billion** (2024)

**Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM):**
- Enterprise companies with complex multi-tier supply chains
- **Fortune 2000** companies (manufacturing, automotive, electronics, aerospace, pharmaceuticals)
- Annual spend on supply chain visibility solutions: **$5-15 million** per enterprise

**Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM):**
- Early adopters: Companies with **high supply chain risk exposure**
- Target: **200-500 enterprises** in first 3 years
- Revenue potential: **$500M+ ARR** at scale

---

### **The Duat Solution: What Others Can't See, We Show**

Duat delivers **months-ahead disruption intelligence** through three core capabilities:

#### **1. Full Upstream Mapping**
We map your entire supply chain ecosystem - from raw material extraction through every tier of processing and assembly.

**Competitive advantage:** While competitors track 1-2 tiers, we track 4-6 tiers deep.

#### **2. Patented Subsurface SAR Intelligence**
Our proprietary satellite data analysis reveals production activity in real-time, regardless of weather, darkness, or attempts to conceal activity.

**Competitive advantage:** Physics-based detection vs. self-reported data.

#### **3. CASCADE Risk Modeling**
Our AI models how disruptions propagate through multi-tier networks, showing not just what's disrupted but what will be disrupted next.

**Competitive advantage:** Predictive intelligence vs. reactive alerts.

---

### **Competitive Landscape**

**Traditional Supply Chain Software:**
- SAP, Oracle, Manhattan Associates
- **Limitation:** Downstream focus, limited predictive capability

**Supply Chain Visibility Platforms:**
- Project44, FourKites, ClearMetal
- **Limitation:** Logistics tracking only, no upstream visibility

**Risk Intelligence Platforms:**
- Resilinc, Everstream Analytics, Interos
- **Limitation:** Relies on reported data and news feeds, weeks-to-months delayed

**Duat's Differentiation:**
✓ Only platform with patented subsurface SAR intelligence  
✓ Only platform mapping full upstream supply chains  
✓ Only platform delivering months-ahead predictions  
✓ Only platform with automated mitigation strategy generation  

**We're not competing in an existing category - we're creating a new one.**

---

### **Go-to-Market Strategy**

**Phase 1: Beachhead (Year 1)**
- Target: Automotive OEMs and Tier 1 suppliers
- Rationale: Highest supply chain complexity, demonstrated willingness to invest in risk mitigation
- Channels: Direct sales via Dean Evans' C-suite network

**Phase 2: Expansion (Years 2-3)**
- Target: Electronics, aerospace, pharmaceuticals

---

### **Why Now**

Three converging trends make 2025 the inflection point for supply chain intelligence:

1. **Geopolitical Fragmentation**
   - US-China trade tensions forcing supply chain restructuring
   - Near-shoring and friend-shoring creating new, complex networks
   - Enterprises need visibility into unfamiliar suppliers and regions

2. **Climate Volatility**
   - Increasing frequency of extreme weather disrupting production
   - Traditional risk models underestimate climate impact on supply chains
   - Satellite-based monitoring provides early warning of climate-related disruptions

3. **AI Maturity**
   - LLMs and agent-based systems enable autonomous intelligence at scale
   - What required armies of analysts 5 years ago now runs autonomously
   - Cost of AI processing dropped 90%+ in 3 years, making our model economically viable

**The window is open. The technology is ready. The market is demanding solutions.**

---

### **The Duat Vision**

**We're building the intelligence layer for global supply chains.**

Five years from now, no major enterprise will make supply chain decisions without consulting platforms like Duat - because operating blind will be unthinkable.

**We're not just preventing disruptions. We're fundamentally changing how enterprises understand and manage their supply chains.**
